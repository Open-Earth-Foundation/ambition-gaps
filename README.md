# Target Stocktaking

Launch notebook on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Open-Earth-Foundation/ambition-gaps/main?urlpath=lab/tree/notebooks/)

Here we show the importance of subnational actors in achieving the Paris agreement goals through case studies using data from Canada, Great Britain, and the United States. We determine how well each country’s nationally determined contribution (NDC) aligns with the required emissions cuts to achieve the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. However, the actual reduction in emissions is the result of a culmination of actions at the province and national level. To that end we compare the aggregate of every subnational 2030 emission target to each country’s NDC to further improve the understanding of the gap between national and aggregate subnational targets; underscoring the importance of policy coordination between subnational and national actors to enable successfully achieving their common overall emissions reduction goal.
